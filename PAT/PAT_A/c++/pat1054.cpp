/*
 ï»¿Behind the scenes in the computer's memory, color is always talked about as a series of 24 bits of information for each pixel. In an image, the color with the largest proportional area is called the dominant color. A strictly dominant color takes more than half of the total area. Now given an image of resolution M by N (for example, 800x600), you are supposed to point out the strictly dominant color.
 Input Specification:
 Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line contains 2 positive numbers: M (<=800) and N (<=600) which are the resolutions of the image. Then N lines follow, each contains M digital colors in the range [0, 224). It is guaranteed that the strictly dominant color exists for each input image. All the numbers in a line are separated by a space.
 Output Specification:
 For each test case, simply print the dominant color in a line.
 Sample Input:
 5 3
 0 0 255 16777215 24
 24 24 0 0 24
 24 0 24 24 24

 Sample Output:
 24
