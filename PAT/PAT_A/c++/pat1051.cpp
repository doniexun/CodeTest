/*
 Given a stack which can keep M numbers at most. Push N numbers in the order of 1, 2, 3, ..., N and pop randomly. You are supposed to tell if a given sequence of numbers is a possible pop sequence of the stack. For example, if M is 5 and N is 7, we can obtain 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 from the stack, but not 3, 2, 1, 7, 5, 6, 4.
 Input Specification:
 Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line contains 3 numbers (all no more than 1000): M (the maximum capacity of the stack), N (the length of push sequence), and K (the number of pop sequences to be checked). Then K lines follow, each contains a pop sequence of N numbers. All the numbers in a line are separated by a space.
 Output Specification:
 For each pop sequence, print in one line "YES" if it is indeed a possible pop sequence of the stack, or "NO" if not.
 Sample Input:
 5 7 5
 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
 3 2 1 7 5 6 4
 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
 5 6 4 3 7 2 1
 1 7 6 5 4 3 2

 Sample Output:
 YES
 NO
 NO
 YES
 NO
