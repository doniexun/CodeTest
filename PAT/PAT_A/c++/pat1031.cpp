/*
 ï»¿Given any string of N (>=5) characters, you are asked to form the characters into the shape of U. For example, "helloworld" can be printed as:
 h  d
 e  l
 l  r
 lowo

 That is, the characters must be printed in the original order, starting top-down from the left vertical line with n1characters, then left to right along the bottom line with n2 characters, and finally bottom-up along the vertical line with n3 characters. And more, we would like U to be as squared as possible -- that is, it must be satisfied that n1 = n3 = max { k| k <= n2 for all 3 <= n2 <= N } with n1 + n2 + n3 - 2 = N.
 Input Specification:
 Each input file contains one test case. Each case contains one string with no less than 5 and no more than 80 characters in a line. The string contains no white space.
 Output Specification:
 For each test case, print the input string in the shape of U as specified in the description.
 Sample Input:
 helloworld!

 Sample Output:
 h   !
 e   d
 l   l
 lowor
