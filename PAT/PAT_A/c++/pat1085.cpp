/*
Given a sequence of positive integers and another positive integer p. The sequence is said to be a "perfect sequence" if M <= m * p where M and m are the maximum and minimum numbers in the sequence, respectively.

Now given a sequence and a parameter p, you are supposed to find from the sequence as many numbers as possible to form a perfect subsequence.

Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line contains two positive integers N and p, where N (<= 105) is the number of integers in the sequence, and p (<= 109) is the parameter. In the second line there are N positive integers, each is no greater than 109.

Output Specification:

For each test case, print in one line the maximum number of integers that can be chosen to form a perfect subsequence.

Sample Input:
10 8
2 3 20 4 5 1 6 7 8 9
Sample Output:
8
