/*
 ï»¿Notice that the number 123456789 is a 9-digit number consisting exactly the numbers from 1 to 9, with no duplication. Double it we will obtain 246913578, which happens to be another 9-digit number consisting exactly the numbers from 1 to 9, only in a different permutation. Check to see the result if we double it again!
 Now you are suppose to check if there are more numbers with this property. That is, double a given number with k digits, you are to tell if the resulting number consists of only a permutation of the digits in the original number.
 Input Specification:
 Each input file contains one test case. Each case contains one positive integer with no more than 20 digits.
 Output Specification:
 For each test case, first print in a line "Yes" if doubling the input number gives a number that consists of only a permutation of the digits in the original number, or "No" if not. Then in the next line, print the doubled number.
 Sample Input:
 1234567899

 Sample Output:
 Yes
 2469135798
