/*
 ï»¿Being unique is so important to people on Mars that even their lottery is designed in a unique way. The rule of winning is simple: one bets on a number chosen from [1, 10^4]. The first one who bets on a unique number wins. For example, if there are 7 people betting on 5 31 5 88 67 88 17, then the second one who bets on 31 wins.
 Input Specification:
 Each input file contains one test case. Each case contains a line which begins with a positive integer N (<=10^5) and then followed by N bets. The numbers are separated by a space.
 Output Specification:
 For each test case, print the winning number in a line. If there is no winner, print "None" instead.
 Sample Input 1:
 7 5 31 5 88 67 88 17

 Sample Output 1:
 31

 Sample Input 2:
 5 888 666 666 888 888

 Sample Output 2:
 None
